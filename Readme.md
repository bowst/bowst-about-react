#Bowst about React

This repository is intended to provide a start-to-finish walkthrough of a building a ReactJS application, with a goal of explaining not just what to do, but the **why** and **how** as well.

Each branch in the repo represents a stage of the set up.  Without further ceremonies, let's jump right in!

##Walkthrough

###Step 1 - Initialization
1. Create a new folder with the name of your project (or initialize an empty repo on github and clone it)
2. Run `npm init`, which will walk you though the command line wizard to create a [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) file
3. Run `npm install --save react react-dom` => installs the [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [ReactDOM](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#reactdom) packages.  Since version 0.14, the react library has been totally decoupled from the browser.  It can currently be used to develop native mobile applications and also be rendered on the server. Thus, `react-dom` is necessary to mount your react code in the browser.
